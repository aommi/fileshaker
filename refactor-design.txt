Fileshaker

initial inputs:
dictionary: sku, filename search keys
assets: directory path (files-to-shake)

pre-process(spreadsheet, data mapping for shaker process, spreadsheet_type:google/microsoft):
read data from spreadsheet
create the dictionary data set
#remove unused data from memory

set brand
for each brand process fileshaker #each brand has its own sort key for assets, has its own vpn mapping
                                  #and will have its own destination brand

process:
fileshaker(input_dictionary, assets: source directory path , excluded filetypes, brand.sortkey)


# for each brand
for each row in the dictionary:
  #this search is used in find in dam dump process too 
  def find assets (searchkey, directory ,excluded filetypes):
    return list of files in directory that match searchkey and are not in excluded filetypes
    # handle to ignore when search key is empty
    # handle case insensitivity
    #handle wild card usage
    #handle if no asset is found

    def sort assets (assets, optional sortkey):
    default sortkey to filename
return sorted assets by sortkey

def rename assets (sorted assets, sku):
  #this is the core functionality which will result in assigning assets to skus
    rename assets[0] to sku
    i=1
    for asset[i] in assets 
    rename assets[i] to sku_ALT-Char(i)

def move (file_name, directoy path, destination directory path)
  #this move is needed so that primary and alt files can be assigned to primary and alt image processing pipeline
  #this could possibly happen at the end of the process too
  check if destination directory exist
  if doesn't exist create
  if exists continue
  handle file extension
  file.rename (destination directory)

timeline log (datetime, sku, signature, process) #[handle quota]
shaker log (search key, sku, number of assets found, ) #[handle quota]

#what happens when we have swatch? - ignore moving swatches
#what happens with MEC brand where the files are named already? ; I think it doesn't matter if that info is lost
# oh maybe this can be the case where the vpn=sku then name in a certain way to just fix the naming
#rather than renaming the whole thing from start
